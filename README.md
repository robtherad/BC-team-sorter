# BC-team-sorter
Simple Python (2.7) program to help the game master sort players into two separate teams. The game master can use the `Player Advantage` box to give one of the teams a numerical advantage over the other. If you already have Python 2.7 and just want the python file only, it's in the source folder along with the 16x icon that it requires. This program shouldn't need any non-standard packages.
