# BC-team-sorter
Simple Python (2.7) program to help the game master sort players into two separate teams. The game master can use the `Player Advantage` box to give one of the teams a numerical advantage over the other. 

You can [download a zip of the repo](https://github.com/robtherad/BC-team-sorter/archive/master.zip) and use the `bcTeamSort.exe` file to launch the program. If you don't want to use the executable you can find the Python 2.7 file in the source folder along with the icon file it requires.
